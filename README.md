Toy just-in-time compiler for arithmetic expressions of floating-point variables x and y, like `sqrt(x*x + y*y) - 2*cos(x+1)`.

The generated machine instructions work on x68-64 linux only.

Inspired by the book "The Go Programming Language" by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan, section 7.9: Example: Expression Evaluator.
